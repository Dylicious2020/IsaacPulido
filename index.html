    <h5><p class="indent bio">
  Isaac Pulido is a professional touring drummer with the Ally Venable Band, based in Houston, TX. He has been proudly endorsed by TRX Cymbals for nearly two years, finding the perfect cymbal sound he has long sought. In addition to his work with Ally Venable, Isaac is part of the original jazz fusion project Phrog and has self-produced, written, released, and performed his own original music. He has performed with Ally Venable for 2 1⁄2 years and Phrog for 1 year.</p>
  
  
  
  <p class="indent">Isaac began playing drums at the age of 6 and has pursued music passionately ever since, earning numerous awards and competition wins throughout high school and college. Under the instruction of JD Guzman at Spring High School, Isaac’s passion for drumming grew. As a senior, he earned 1st chair in the top ensemble at the 2016 TMEA All-State Jazz competition, which solidified his decision to pursue a higher education in music. He graduated from Texas State University in 2021 with a Jazz Performance bachelor’s degree, studying under legendary jazz drummer Butch Miles and receiving the award for outstanding undergraduate student in 2019. During his time at Texas State, Isaac performed and traveled with the Texas State Jazz Ensemble, Jazz Orchestra, and Jazz Combo quartets. The Jazz Ensemble competed at the 2020 Notre Dame Collegiate Jazz Festival in Indiana, where he received an award for best soloist.</p>
  
  
  
  <p class="indent">Isaac has remained active in the Austin, TX music scene, networking and building relationships with mentors. He has shared the stage and toured with notable blues rock artists such as Buddy Guy, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Eric Gales, Christone “Kingfish” Ingram, Bernard Allison, and Colin James. Isaac has performed in large theaters, amphitheaters, and festivals year-round, as well as headlining sold-out shows in the U.S. and overseas. He recently recorded an upcoming album set to release in 2025 through Ruf Records, produced by Tom Hambridge in Nashville, TN.</p>
  
  
  
  <p class="indent">Phrog released a full-length album of original music in March 2024, with a sound inspired by artists like Knower and Thumpasaurus, blending jazz, funk, rock, metal, dance, house, and drum and bass. Isaac’s original music spans a wide range of genres including alternative rock, indie, rap, hip hop, R&B, new wave, pop, lofi, house, EDM, and jazz. He continuously creates, whether on the road, in the studio, or at home, always pushing the boundaries of his musical expression.</p></h5>
